## Notes

Today's PR is a partial fix to a bug report filed last November, [#17603
"partial spend avoidance makes partial spends and getbalances doesn't
notice."](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17603) In that issue,
Bitcoin Core contributor [dooglus](https://github.com/dooglus) describes two
ways the wallet does not behave as expected when using the `avoid_reuse` wallet
flag (sidenote: this issue is an excellent example of a good bug report, with
detailed steps to reproduce the issue).

This PR addresses one of the two bugs with a fairly small fix, but there is much
to dig into regarding `avoid_reuse`, coin selection, and whether this is the
best solution to the problem.

The `avoid_reuse` wallet flag was introduced in
[#13756](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13756) by
[kallewoof](https://github.com/kallewoof), who subsequently followed it up with
[#16239](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16239) to mitigate exposure to
[dust
attacks](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/81508/deanonymizing-dust-attack/81509#81509). The
`avoid_reuse` feature achieves this by:
  1. avoiding spending from destinations that the wallet has previously spent from,
and
  2. attempting to sweep larger parts of the outputs to a destination when it
does spend, from a destination that has multiple outputs available.

Today's PR addresses the latter of the two. The main keyword to look for in the
code is `GroupOutputs`.

The other error reported in issue
[#17603](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17603) was a
misrepresentation of the wallet balances in the RPC `getbalances`. This was
resolved by [#17843 "wallet: Reset reused transactions
cache"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17843).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. This PR deals with the broad topic of Coin Selection (here is a recommended
[reference
work](http://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf)
on the subject by [Murch](https://github.com/Xekyo)). Coin selection changes seem
to have a hard time getting reviews. Why do you think that is? What are some bad
things that can happen if something goes wrong in coin selection?

3. What is the problem with coin reuse? How can it be exploited, and what
approach does the `avoid_reuse` feature employ to solve it? Are you aware of
other ways to mitigate attacks, perhaps implemented by other privacy-focused
wallets?

4. Can you describe the problem this PR tries to solve in your own words, including
the necessary pre-conditions?

5. How does this PR currently attempt to resolve the issue?

6. How does the current approach compare to [the previously proposed
approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17824#issuecomment-569928051)
by the author? Can you think of other (better?) ways to solve it?

7. More generally, do you like the way `avoid_reuse` currently handles this case
of coin selection? Can you think of different solutions to the problem?

## Meeting Log
```
13:17 < jonatack> git grepping shows EXTRA_DESCENDANT_TX_SIZE_LIMIT = 10000, related?
13:26 < fjahr> yeah, that's also my understanding but I took it from kalle's suggestion here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17824#issuecomment-570548151 and did not explicitly clarify if he chose it for another reason.
13:27 < jonatack> right, thanks, it's the only place i saw it too... I think the value should be commented and maybe hoisted to a static constant
13:27 < fjahr> I think at the time the carve-out discussion for lightning was still fresh and I just accepted it as the same number in the back of my head
13:28 < fjahr> jonatack: good point
13:28 < jonatack> also, if you have to retouch, can you make this mini-edit to the avoid_reuse test?
13:28 < jonatack> self.log.info("Test fund send fund send {}".format(second_addr_type))
13:29 < fjahr> haha, yeah, I have seen that a lot, will do :)
13:29 < jonatack> :)
13:30 < jonatack> instead of self.log.info("Test fund send fund send")
13:30 < jonatack> since it's called several times
13:30 < kanzure> ah, "an hour and ten minutes from now" was misleading
13:33 < jonatack> (i don't think anyone will mind if you slip that change into your commit)
13:46 < emzy> day light saving is crazy. Time zones, too.
13:47 < fjahr> Bitcoin fixes this, let's just use blockheight :p
13:48 < pinheadmz> I have a bitcoin block clock over here :-)
14:00 < fjahr> I think it's time
14:00 < fjahr> #startmeeting
14:01 < willcl_ark> hi
14:01 < jnewbery> hi
14:01 < fjahr> Hey everyone! Welcome to this weeks edition of the PR Review Club.
14:01 < lightlike> hi
14:01 < ajonas> hi
14:01 < jkczyz> hi
14:01 < platesondeck> Hello
14:01 < nothingmuch> hi
14:01 < pinheadmz> hi
14:01 < jonatack_> hi
14:01 < fjahr> We are talking about a PR from I made about 2 months ago. There are not a lot LOC to review but personally I learned a lot about avoid_reuse/avoidparticalspend and how it effects coin selection so I hope you find it interesting. Also I want to pick your brain if this is the best possible solution to the problem :)
14:01 < emzy> hi
14:02 < michaelfolkson> hi
14:02 < notmurch> hello
14:02 < pinheadmz> yeah i didnt even know this was a wallet feature
14:03 < fjahr> Let's start with the typical first questions but just ask any questions at any point and I will try to keep up: Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? (Donâ€™t forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)
14:03 < fjahr> pinheadmz: it was also new to me
14:03 < jonatack> Concept ACK; studying the implementation
14:04 < fjahr> Maybe also someone who also recreated the bug? The original bug issue had nice command line instructions for regtest.
14:05 < jonatack> Yes, reproduced it while reviewing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17838
14:05 < willcl_ark> yes concept ACK for me also. I'm always surprised how difficult to implement coin selection seems to be
14:05 < jonatack> "test: test the >10 UTXO case for output groups"
14:06 < jonatack> which you fixed with #17843
14:06 < fjahr> Great, maybe let's move on to my next question: This PR deals with the broad topic of Coin Selection. Coin selection changes seem to have a hard time getting reviews. Why do you think that is? What are some bad things that can happen if something goes wrong in coin selection?
14:07 < pinheadmz> coin selection is responsible for TX size, fee, privacy...
14:07 < willcl_ark> I think it's because there is no "correct" answer for which tradeoffs are best for any given user situation
14:07 < willcl_ark> does a user want "more private", or "cheaper"  for example...
14:07 < amiti> its really hard to properly predict the possible eventual effects of small changes to coin selection can have .. since it can compound over time
14:08 < michaelfolkson> So I can't remember where this was discussed. Maybe on a podcast. But didn't Murch's changes based on his thesis get reverted?
14:08 < pinheadmz> michaelfolkson: murch mentioned that to me yeah
14:08 < jonatack> My impression from talking with achow101 is that few people understand it well, apart from notmurch and I suppose people like instagibbs, kallewoof, achow101, and few have to deal with very large wallets
14:08 < pinheadmz> i was surprised this is feature even a thing -- IIUC, we spend 10 UTXOs just to consolidate addresses?
14:09 < willcl_ark> achow101 also has some Twitch streams where he talks a lot about coin selection :)
14:09 < jonatack> and bitcoin core's wallet isn't adapted to large-scale exchange-sized applications afaik
14:09 < michaelfolkson> What was the reason for reverting Murch's changes? Some impact on the network?
14:09 < jnewbery> pinheadmz: I don't think 'consolidate addresses' is the right way of putting this. The aim is to spend all outputs to the same address in the same tx
14:10 < pinheadmz> sure couldnt think of a good term
14:10 < fjahr> jnewbery: yes!
14:10 < pinheadmz> but still, you could end up with a TX 10x in size to gain this privacy
14:10 < jnewbery> (consolidate addresses implies to me the opposite - that you're taking multiple addresses and doing something that would link them)
14:11 < pinheadmz> its a UTXO consolidation though
14:11 < notmurch> michaelfolkson: my initial dabblings with Coin Selection got reverted but it was two years before my thesis
14:11 < pinheadmz> kind of pretending that all outputs to an address are just one big single utxo
14:11 < pinheadmz> murch is here!
14:12 < jonatack> michaelfolkson: (iirc that was an livera podcast with achow101 that you are referring to)
14:12 < fjahr> pinheadmz: yepp, and even more if you spend multiple groups
14:12 < pinheadmz> fjahr: so this could be an expensive mechanism. Was it controversial?
14:12 < michaelfolkson> Ah cool. So the primary conclusions of the thesis haven't been discarded notmurch?
14:13 < achow101> michaelfolkson: murch's thesis is the BnB coin selection algo we use in core now
14:13 < notmurch> My first attempt to change Bitcoin Core's coin selection made it stop spending uneconomic inputs
14:13 < achow101> I'm kind of trying to get the second half of his conclusions into core as well (the random selection fallback part)
14:13 < michaelfolkson> Cool, thanks. And thanks jonatack yup. Transcript is here: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/99/
14:13 < fjahr> pinheadmz: I didn't go through that again in my prepbut I can not remember a big discussion
14:13 < notmurch> this caused a notable increase in the UTXO set in the following months and got it reverted
14:14 < jonatack> yes, see src/wallet/coinselection.cpp::20-
14:14 < jonatack> for the BnB algo
14:15 < fjahr> Ok, pinheadmz: I remember there were some comments on the number 10 but it was kind of accepted, can not find it now
14:15 < fjahr> strike the ok :)
14:15 < fjahr> Well, next question: What is the problem with coin reuse? How can it be exploited, and what approach does the avoid_reuse feature employ to solve it? Are you aware of other ways to mitigate attacks, perhaps implemented by other privacy-focused wallets?
14:15 < jnewbery> pinheadmz: can you explain why 'this could be an expensive mechanism'?
14:16 < pinheadmz> jnewbery: adding 10 inputs to a TX when only 1 is sufifcient to cover the output value ?
14:17 < amiti> my understanding is that the `avoid_reuse` feature is mainly a way to prevent a dust attack?
14:17 < platesondeck> i'm sorry, but could someone pls explain to me what exactly you mean by coin reuse?
14:17 < fjahr> amiti: right, someone want to define dust attack?
14:17 < notmurch> platesondeck: when funds are received to the same address twice
14:17 < fjahr> address reuse, sorry :)
14:17 < jnewbery> pinheadmz: those 10 inputs need to be spent eventually! It's only more expensive if either (i) you happen to create the spend during a high-feerate period (ii) somehow using more inputs prevents BnB from finding a solution that doesn't create change
14:18 < andrewtoth_> jnewbery why can't the other 9 inputs be hodled forever?
14:18 < ecurrencyhodler> Dust attack: It's when someone sends a small amount of Bitcoin to a known Bitcoin address to track it and see if they can link it to other parts of your Bitcoin holdings.
14:18 < amiti> a dust attack is where an adversary sends dust to lots of different addresses, then waits to see where its used to link to other addresses
14:19 < platesondeck> fjahr ok the terminology threw me for a loop
14:19 < jnewbery> andrewtoth_: :)
14:19 < fjahr> amiti, ecurrencyhodler: correct
14:19 < notmurch> andrewtoth_: if you ever want to make use of the value of an unspent, it will need to be spent eventually
14:19 < fjahr> platesondeck: sorry about that
14:20 < notmurch> Regarding dusting: the main issue is that these dust utxo will be picked up by another transaction leaving the wallet creating a link between two addresses. In combination with the "single sender" heuristic
14:20 < notmurch> this allows to tie together a larger cluster of addresses
14:21 < jkczyz> notmurch: but if it's dust, it presumably doesn't (or didn't) have much value and wasn't yours to begin with. Is the only reason not to eventually spend to avoid UTXO bloat?
14:21 < notmurch> *a link between the previous transaction and the new transaction
14:21 < fjahr> on the 10 inputs: in terms of privacy also you have only one chance for the first time you spent from a destination, so ideally you can sweep all of it at once but 10 is the arbitrary cut-off
14:21 < notmurch> jkczyz what if what's dust today eventually is worth spending?
14:21 < willcl_ark> why not always spend all from the address?
14:21 < ecurrencyhodler> Tying @notmurch's comment in with address reuse: If someone sends dust to an address and it is reused, then the wallet will include it into a spend which would tie together that cluster of addresses.
14:21 < platesondeck> could there be a wallet feature that picks a dust utxo and uses it to fill the mining fee for a regular transaction gradually instead of waiting to collect all the dust in one big pile
14:22 < pinheadmz> i wonder if this will even be an issue as bip44 wallets dominate
14:23 < fjahr> willcl_ark: because that might then result in high fees, the 10 outputs group limit is trying to strike a balance
14:23 < notmurch> platesondeck: the link is being created by a transaction referencing the UTXO in its inputs. Hence that's indistinguishable from any other way of spending it ;)
14:23 < jkczyz> notmurch: understood but it could still be considered dust relative to the rest of your coins ;)
14:24 < fjahr> Bonus question: who can give a quick definition of a "destination" as it is used in this context?
14:24 < willcl_ark> fjahr: but if you have more than 10, then using _only_ 10 seems like it has all been for nothing? Might as well choose "up to 10, if <=10 total" or else disregard this policy for this address?
14:24 < jonatack> Does anyone know how the outputs groups limit (OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES = 10 in wallet.cpp::46) was decided?
14:24 < andrewtoth_> destination would be any address derived from same pubkey, so could be p2pkh, wrapped p2sh, p2wpkh
14:25 < willcl_ark> e.g.: if you have 12 UTXO at that address, and you use only 10, still another spend will link them, therefore using 10 previously, when you only needed 1, was just wasting tx fees?
14:25 < fjahr> jonatack: should be in the avoidparticalspend code, but i did not pull it up
14:27 < jnewbery> willcl_ark: using inputs early is not wasting fees. Those inputs need to be spent eventually
14:27 < fjahr> willcl_ark: you are already getting towards my later questions :) buy maybe I can pull it up.
14:28 < fjahr> How about we discuss this q first which was last in my notes: More generally, do you like the way avoid_reuse/avoidpartialspends currently handles this case of coin selection? Can you think of different solutions to the problem?
14:28 < jnewbery> there may be some minor effect from giving BnB less freedom in the way it chooses inputs, but simply using up a UTXO now instead of later does not change the total fee across time that the wallet pays
14:28 < ecurrencyhodler> What is BnB short for?
14:28 < fjahr> Branch'n;Bound
14:29 < willcl_ark> jnewbery: hmmmm. Let me think about this. I agree that the second spend is not so costly, because you already merged those 9 un-needed UTXOs into a single change output, but I will need to "spend them twice" to spend them once, if you see what I mean
14:30 < jonatack> fjahr: i see it was added by kallewoof in 18f690e "wallet: shuffle coins before grouping, where warranted"
14:31 < fjahr> jonatack: ok, I think I remember promag asking about the number and kalle said it was kind of arbitrarily chosen, or am I making that up? :)
14:31 < jonatack> but he hoisted the pre-existing value of 10 to a constant, it was already previously set to 10
14:32 < jonatack> yes, seems so
14:32 < jnewbery> willcl_ark: it's useful to draw out all the inputs/outputs from multiple transactions to get your head around it. If you assume constant feerate (which is a bad assumption), then the only way you can save on tx fees is by avoiding creating change outputs. Any other strategy of spending your UTXOs will result in the same txfees.
14:32 < jonatack> "Cases where we have 11+ outputs all pointing to the same destination may result in privacy leaks as they will potentially be deterministically sorted."
14:34 < fjahr> So does anyone else have opinions on wills question? I personally have the feeling that this is kind of an edge case and while the could be a better algorithm it might not be worth the effort to implement in this case? Do you agree or disagree?
14:34 < jnewbery> here's the comment where 10 was chosen: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12257/files#r204171876
14:35 < willcl_ark> hmmm. seems to me then in response to jnewbery and fjahr's earlier question, that the easiest solution to reason about is to have the policy that "all UTXO at an address always spent together", which could then warn the user if #UTXO > 10,  and of course be opted out of... otherwise the user is not sure what they are getting?
14:35 < jonatack> jnewbery: thanks!
14:35 < platesondeck> This might be a bad question but is there a way to send small change amounts to your lightning node at the time of transaction? Would that still result in some trail when the channel is closed later on?
14:36 < willcl_ark> I guess some static donation addresses exist which could have _very_ high numbers of UTXOs though
14:36 < pinheadmz> 1andreas... :-)
14:37 < willcl_ark> jnewbery: I see your fee argument now; you are just paying the fee _now_, instead of _later_ :)
14:39 < michaelfolkson> platesondeck: You mean increase the size of an existing channel (splicing) or opening a new channel? Currently (before Schnorr) you would still see funds have been sent to a 2-of-2 multisig address and then left that 2-of-2 address
14:39 < jnewbery> willcl_ark: exactly. You can think of the fee as already implicitly part of the each UTXO. In fact, BnB uses the implicit amount of UTXOs when selecting them (the value of the UTXO minus the fee required to spend it)
14:40 < fjahr> platesondeck: you could also do a submarine swap with someone but that is not something that would implement in the core wallet
14:41 < fjahr> Aside from the more broad discussion on coin selection: Can you describe the problem this PR tries to solve in your own words, including the necessary pre-conditions?
14:41 < jnewbery> whenever you create a transaction in your wallet, it results in either one new UTXO (change) or zero new UTXOs (no change) in your wallet. You save fees in the long run if you can make transactions that result in no new UTXOs in your wallet.
14:41 < chanho> jnewbery: so the crux of the argument assuming constant fee rate seems to be that you essentially want to minimize the number of change outputs when you consider all the ways of spending the total of the given UTXO set?
14:42 < pinheadmz> fjahr: I think the bug is, if you have 11 utxos for 1 destination, instead of spending the group of 10, it spends the "group" of 1
14:42 < jnewbery> chanho: yes, that's true in general. Less change outputs => less txfees
14:43 < pinheadmz> but then it also labels the the group of 10 as already resused
14:44 < fjahr> pinheadmz: yes, or more generally 'mod 10' could also be 21, 12 etc.
14:45 < fjahr> the case described in the issue where mod10 is 1 certainly looks the weirdest to the user because it seems likee the wallet flag is not working
14:45 < jonatack> chanho: minimising tx fees and also maximising privacy by minimising addresses used together and preferring split over several utxos
14:45 < notmurch> sorry for slow reply, willcl_ark: by sweeping in two transactions, the cost increases are having a second output, paying for two transaction headers and having to spend two inputs later instead of one.
14:46 < willcl_ark> sorry to be hung up on this, I hope I'm not de-railing... but why not: if (can be done without change); else (spend all from address)?
14:48 < fjahr> all good, as I said in the beginning it's the point of this review club to learn about this stuff and since we have the experts here... :)
14:48 < notmurch> chanho: avoiding change also improves privacy and also increases the amount of balance that remains spendable in your wallet
14:50 < fjahr> On the PR specifically: How does this PR currently attempt to resolve the issue? What 'mechanism' is it using?
14:52 < pinheadmz> well theres this new vecotr of detinations called full_groups
14:53 < fjahr> pinheadmz: yes, but what is doing with the group that is not full?
14:53 < pinheadmz> and i know from context its preferring it
14:53 < pinheadmz> but the it.second and it.first stuff is out of my scope
14:54 < pinheadmz> looks like it iterates through the full_groups first
14:54 < fjahr> the key are the ancestors
14:55 < pinheadmz> yeah so that comes in to play later in the coin selection algortihm?
14:55 < pinheadmz> like theres no other "pregerence" property?
14:55 < fjahr> yes, it is currently using the number of ancestors (max_anchestors - 1) to 'penalize' the 'mod 10 leftovers' group so it gets chosen last
14:56 < pinheadmz> so maybe this is too low level but "for (auto& it : gmap)" -- creates an iterator `it` ?
14:57 < pinheadmz> and that has .first and .sceond properties?
14:57 < fjahr> You can see how it takes effect in 'SelectCoins' in the that starts with 'bool res = value_to_select <= 0 ||'
14:57 < fjahr> only 3 minutes left, shoot if you have any questions left :)
14:58 < jnewbery> I have a question: does 10 inputs seem aggressively low to people, given the goal is to avoid transactions becoming too big?
14:58 < jonatack> I'm curious where the 9999 and 10000 max ancestor values come from, and need to study SelectCoins()
14:58 < fjahr> pinheadmz: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2395
14:59 < Murch> jnewbery:Could you define the goal more specifically?
14:59 < platesondeck> if you already have dust would it be more privacy preserving to collect 1 piece of dust with your next transaction instead of all together?
14:59 < jnewbery> a regular P2PKH tx with 10 inputs and 2 outputs is ~1500 vbytes, which isn't enormous. We've seen much larger utxo consolidations than that
14:59 < jnewbery> Murch: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12257/files#r204171876
15:00 < jnewbery> oh no. What happens when a Murch and a notmurch collide?
15:00 < Murch> jnewbery: Well, when the fees are high, ten inputs is kinda sizeable already. When the fees are low, 10 isn't all that much
15:00 < Murch> platesondeck: depends on whether they're on the same address or different ones
15:00 < nothingmuch> is thinking of n outputs with a single yet unused script as a single output with n times the overhead missing anything?
15:00 < fjahr> platesondeck: can you be more specific? dust in the same destination?
15:01 < jnewbery> well if you're going to talk about coin selection being dynamic to prevailing feerates, that's a whole larger topic
15:01 < nothingmuch> if not, i would have expected limiting the size to have happened afterwards (i.e. first select unbounded group, then only spend up to some limit from it) instead of constructing separate groups ahead of time
15:01 < jnewbery> I'm just saying that if the goal is to avoid large txs, then we can go a lot higher than 10 inputs, which would confer these privacy benefits on more users
15:02 < willcl_ark> tbh, 10 seems ok for "regular users" (from personal experience), I guess anything larger than that is just "considered edge case"?
15:02 < jonatack> fjahr: it seems to me that adding more documentation in your PR on these things while working on it and figuring it all out could be a real value-add
15:02 < Murch> jnewbery: well, at one sat per vB, I like my txes to have 50+ inputs :p
15:02 < amiti> pinheadmz: `for (auto& it: gmap)` creates an iterator `it` that just points to each element and iterates through. in this case, gmap is a `std::map<CTxDestination, OutputGroup>`, so first and second point to the tx-dest vs output-group respectively
15:02 < jnewbery> I think having a limit of 10 also changes the dust attack from "send one dust output to the address" to "send 11 dust outputs to the address", rather than removing it entirely, no?
15:03 < michaelfolkson> Agreed jonatack
15:03 < Murch> nothingmuch: you could see it like that if you always enforce avoiding partial spends
15:03 < fjahr> jonatack: do you mean on the features I am editing or the change itself?
15:04 < willcl_ark> jnewbery: does a dust attck have to send to an "empty" (previously all spent) address? if there are already UTXOs there, then does dust make any difference vs tracking a current UTXO?
15:04 < jnewbery> Murch: yes, but that's a much more general topic than for destination groups. I want my coin selection to choose few inputs when fees are high and many inputs when fees are low. That's a more general thing than just destination groups.
15:05 < Murch> jnewbery: for avoiding partial spends yeah, I would agree that 10 is kinda low. However, if you already got paid ten times to the same address, it sounds a lot more likely you will receive future payments there againâ€¦
15:05 < jonatack> fjahr: the changeset for sure. maybe an extra commit for relevant related code
15:05 < fjahr> ok, we are 5 minutes over so I will call #endmeeting but feel free to keep the conversation going :)
15:06 < jnewbery> Thanks fjahr. Great meeting!
15:06 < Murch> willcl_ark: no, a dust attack can also send to an address that has coins currently already
15:06 < jonatack> jnewbery: maybe add a config or option arg?
15:06 < michaelfolkson> Nice work fjahr on your first one :)
15:06 < fjahr> Thanks everyone for participating, especially murch!
15:06 < willcl_ark> Murch: what is the difference between just tracking an already-existing UTXO in that case?
15:07 < Murch> willcl_ark: if the user decides to spend anyway, it may increase the cost of their transaction
15:07 < willcl_ark> thanks fjahr!
15:07 < jnewbery> before you all go, I'm thinking of moving the meeting back to 17:00 UTC next week. That'd put it back to the same local time for people in the US, but would make it an hour early in local time for people in Europe, until your DST starts.
15:07 < amiti> thanks for hosting fjahr! I'm very unfamiliar with this part of the code & this was helpful exposure
15:07 < jnewbery> any agreement/objections to that?
15:07 < andrewtoth_> Thanks fjahr and everyone!
15:07 < pinheadmz> yes thanks everyone!
15:07 < docallag> Thanks fjahr
15:07 < andrewtoth_> Either time works for me
15:08 < jonatack> jnewbery: no objections here to earlier
15:08 < docallag> In Europe but +1 on the time change
15:08 < Murch> willcl_ark: A lot of wallets actually don't track address reuse, so the expected outcome in many cases would be that people spend it in two different transactions later. Sending to an address that has money still, makes it more likely that someone is sill tracking it, though.
15:08 < platesondeck> good meeting fjahr
15:08 < jonatack> thanks fjahr, great meeting
15:08 < nothingmuch> hmmm, apart from identifying which output is payment and which is change, which is arguably already an issue, is there any downside to later spending marked used outputs only together with change already related to them? trying to figure out if fee considerations and privacy considerations can be considered independently
15:09 < Murch> fjahr: it was fun :)
15:09 < jnewbery> (with apologies to anyone in the southern hemisphere or who don't have DST)
15:10 < willcl_ark> Murch: I kind of understand
15:10 < jonatack> Murch: thanks for swinging by, coin selection is a topic we could definitely spend more time thinking about.
15:10 < Murch> nothingmuch: interesting question
15:11 < Murch> my pleasure
15:12 < Murch> nothingmuch: Privacy is definitely the more mind-boggling one of those
15:13 < nothingmuch> yeah it's related to my previous question... i'm very confused/ambivalent about this behaviour so i'm trying to find equivalences to simplify my mental model
15:14 < jonatack> nothingmuch: agree, seems worth thinking about
15:14 < willcl_ark> might be nice to be able to configure the 10 value at spend time witha flag, or a conf option
15:14 < Murch> I think revealing which one was change might actually be worse than connecting it with another address, still mulling though
15:15 < nothingmuch> and afaict the consolidation can be delayed indefinitely from a privacy POV so long as it ends up in an equivalent state
15:15 < nothingmuch> yes, definitely a serious issue
15:16 < nothingmuch> "arguably already an issue" - i'm assuming here (perhaps incorrectly) that the payment amount is relatively small, so unnecessary input heuristic could identify the change address
15:16 < Murch> nothingmuch: e.g. it would reveal more about what sort of wallet you're running which may allow other guesses such as whether it's possible that there was more than one change
15:17 < jnewbery> willcl_ark jonatack: There's always a temptation when faced with a difficult design decision to resort to "add a config option". I think that's usually the wrong decision, because most people never use them, and they lead to combinatorial complexity.
15:18 < Murch> Right, but let's say you're spending more in the second tx, and it uses multiple inputs. All of them being related to the address that was dusted would be pretty unlikely, so it tells us more about either your wallet composition or your wallt software
15:18 < jonatack> jnewbery: true, and same for changing the value dynamically WRT fees.
15:20 < nothingmuch> Murch: good point
15:20 < nothingmuch> fwiw my mental model for this was suppose don't enable avoid_reuse, and later realize i should have, what would i do manually
15:22 < willcl_ark> jnewbery: I see your point. It does seem a shame though to have an arbritrary and fixed group value hardcoded IMO
